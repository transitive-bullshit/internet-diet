## Intro

If you order a lot of online food.

And a lot of it is unhealthy.

Then here's an easy way to block yourself from ordering any of the crap.

## What can it block?

- individual restaurants
- individual menu items
- individual grocery items
- individual URLs
- entire websites

When blocking individual restaurants and menu items, it will remove them from the page so you won't even see them as tempting options.

## Example use cases

- block all mcdonalds restaurants on postmates
- block all soda on amazon fresh
- block all of drizly.com
- etc.

## TODO

This project is a WIP and lacks UI / polish / tests / etc.
