> Chrome extension to remove unhealthy food options from the web.

## Intro

I order online food all the time.

But a lot of the options are unhealthy — which is a constant temptation.

So I built an easy way to block all the unwanted crap.

## What can it block?

- individual restaurants
- individual menu items
- individual grocery items
- individual URLs
- entire websites

When blocking individual restaurants and menu items, it will blur them on the page so you won't even see them as options.

## Example use cases

- block all mcdonalds restaurants on postmates
- block that one chinese place on doordash
- block any soda menu items on grubhub
- block all candy results on amazon fresh
- block all of drizly.com
- etc.

## TODO

This project is a WIP and lacks UI / polish / tests / etc.

- [x] handle page updates and slow client-side refresh
- [ ] add popup UI
- [ ] add options UI
- [ ] make block rules customizable
- [ ] make block redirect customizable
- [ ] track the number of links and items blocked
- [ ] add examples
